# Overview

In this project, it is implemented a toy example of a “Double Dispatch” in Java.

The implementation is achieved via the Visitor pattern.

Alternative solutions to the problem are also provided: a naive one, not working, and another one, working, which however makes use of some anti-patterns.

Unit Tests aimed at demonstrating the above points are provided.
